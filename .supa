  Step 1: Create Your Admin User

  Go to your app at /admin/login and sign up with any email/password.

  Step 2: Get Your User ID

  1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
  2. Find your user and copy the UID (looks like: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc)

  Step 3: Promote to Admin

  In SQL Editor, run:
  SELECT public.promote_to_admin('paste-your-uid-here');

  SELECT * FROM public.profiles WHERE role = 'admin';

  You should see your user with role = 'admin'.
